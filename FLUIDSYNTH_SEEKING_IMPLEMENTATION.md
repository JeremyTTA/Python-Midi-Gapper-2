# FluidSynth MIDI Seeking Implementation

## Problem Solved
The original issue was that pygame.mixer.music does not support seeking to specific positions in MIDI files. When users scrolled to a position and pressed play, audio would start from the beginning while visuals showed the scrolled position.

## Previous Approach (Temporary Files)
The previous solution attempted to work around pygame's limitation by:
1. Using mido to scan through the MIDI file to find messages at/after the target position
2. Creating a temporary MIDI file containing only those messages
3. Playing the temp file with pygame (starting from "beginning" = target position)

**Issues with this approach:**
- Temporary files were often malformed or empty
- Complex timing calculations needed for visual sync
- Fragile and error-prone
- Still not "real" seeking

## New Approach (FluidSynth)
The new implementation uses FluidSynth, a software synthesizer that supports direct MIDI seeking:

### Key Components

#### 1. FluidSynth Integration
- **Library**: `pyfluidsynth`
- **Installation**: `pip install pyfluidsynth`
- **Capability**: Real-time MIDI synthesis with seeking support

#### 2. Initialization (`init_fluidsynth()`)
```python
# Create FluidSynth synthesizer
self.fs = fluidsynth.new_fluid_synth()

# Create audio driver
self.audio_driver = fluidsynth.new_fluid_audio_driver(self.fs)

# Load soundfont for audio generation
fluidsynth.fluid_synth_sfload(self.fs, soundfont_path, 1)
```

#### 3. Seeking Implementation (`start_fluidsynth_playback()`)
```python
# Create player and load MIDI file
player_id = fluidsynth.new_fluid_player(self.fs)
fluidsynth.fluid_player_add(player_id, midi_file_path)

# Direct seeking to target position
if position > 0.1:
    target_tick = calculate_tick_position(position)
    fluidsynth.fluid_player_seek(player_id, target_tick)

# Start playback from sought position
fluidsynth.fluid_player_play(player_id)
```

### Benefits

#### ✅ Real Seeking Support
- Direct seeking to any position in MIDI files
- No temporary file creation needed
- Immediate playback from target position

#### ✅ Simplified Code
- Eliminates complex temporary file logic
- No visual offset calculations
- Cleaner error handling

#### ✅ Better Audio Quality
- FluidSynth provides higher quality synthesis
- Better instrument support
- More accurate MIDI interpretation

#### ✅ Robust Fallback
- Automatically falls back to pygame if FluidSynth unavailable
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Graceful degradation

### Implementation Details

#### Dual Playback System
```python
def start_midi_playback(self):
    if FLUIDSYNTH_AVAILABLE and self.use_fluidsynth:
        self.start_fluidsynth_playback()  # Real seeking
    else:
        self.start_pygame_playback()      # Fallback with temp files
```

#### Position Calculation
FluidSynth uses tick-based seeking, so time positions are converted:
```python
midi_file = mido.MidiFile(self.current_midi_file)
total_ticks = sum(msg.time for track in midi_file.tracks for msg in track)
target_tick = int((position_seconds / midi_file.length) * total_ticks)
```

#### Resource Management
```python
def stop_midi(self):
    if self.use_fluidsynth and self.fluidsynth_player:
        fluidsynth.fluid_player_stop(self.fluidsynth_player)
        fluidsynth.delete_fluid_player(self.fluidsynth_player)
```

### User Experience

#### Before (pygame + temp files)
1. User scrolls to 60 seconds
2. User presses play
3. "Creating temporary MIDI file..." (2-3 seconds delay)
4. Audio starts, may be from wrong position
5. Complex visual sync attempting to match audio

#### After (FluidSynth)
1. User scrolls to 60 seconds
2. User presses play
3. Audio immediately starts from 60 seconds
4. Perfect audio/visual synchronization

### Testing
Run `test_fluidsynth_seeking.py` to verify:
- FluidSynth initialization
- Seeking functionality
- Fallback behavior
- Audio quality

### Dependencies
```bash
pip install pyfluidsynth mido pygame
```

### Soundfont Requirements
FluidSynth requires a soundfont for audio generation. The implementation automatically searches for:
- Windows: `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\gm.dls`
- Common locations for SF2 files
- Falls back gracefully if none found

### Conclusion
This implementation provides true MIDI seeking capability, eliminating the need for complex temporary file workarounds and delivering immediate, accurate playback from any position in MIDI files.
