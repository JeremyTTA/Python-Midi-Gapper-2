# Keyboard Highlighting Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented real-time keyboard highlighting that shows which notes are currently playing based on the playback position. The 88-key Synthesia-style keyboard now visually indicates active notes during MIDI playback and manual position changes.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Keyboard Key Storage and Reference System
- Added `self.keyboard_keys = {}` dictionary to store MIDI note number → canvas object ID mappings
- Modified `draw_keyboard()` to store references to both white and black key canvas objects
- Each key is tagged with `f'key_{note}'` for easy identification

### 2. Real-time Note Highlighting Logic
- **New Method**: `update_keyboard_highlighting()`
  - Resets all keys to default colors (white/black)
  - Finds notes that should be playing at current `self.playback_position`
  - Checks note start_time ≤ playback_position ≤ (start_time + duration)
  - Respects deleted channels (doesn't highlight notes from deleted channels)
  - Highlights active keys with distinct colors:
    - White keys: Light blue (`#B0D0FF`)
    - Black keys: Bright blue (`#4080FF`)

### 3. Integration with Playback System
- **Playback Timer**: Added `self.update_keyboard_highlighting()` to `update_playback_timer()`
  - Updates highlighting every 100ms during playback
  - Synchronized with LED clock and scrollbar updates

- **Manual Position Changes**: Added highlighting update to `on_scroll_with_midi_sync()`
  - Updates highlighting when user moves scrollbar
  - Provides immediate visual feedback for manual position changes

- **Playback Stop**: Added highlighting update to `stop_midi()`
  - Clears all highlighted keys when playback stops
  - Resets keyboard to default appearance

### 4. Visual Design
- **Color Scheme**: Blue-based highlighting for musical coherence
  - Bright blue for black keys: stands out against dark background
  - Light blue for white keys: visible but not overwhelming
- **Performance**: Efficient canvas item updates using `itemconfig()`
- **Accessibility**: Clear visual distinction between active and inactive keys

## Technical Implementation Details

### Key Storage Structure
```python
self.keyboard_keys = {
    21: canvas_object_id,    # A0
    22: canvas_object_id,    # A#0
    # ... for all 88 keys (MIDI notes 21-108)
    108: canvas_object_id    # C8
}
```

### Note Tracking Logic
```python
# For each note in visualization data:
if note_start <= self.playback_position <= note_end:
    currently_playing_notes.add(note_data['note'])
```

### Highlighting Update Points
1. **During Playback**: Every 100ms via playback timer
2. **Manual Seeking**: When scrollbar position changes
3. **Playback Stop**: To clear highlighted keys
4. **Position Reset**: When playback position is reset to 0

## Benefits
- **Real-time Visual Feedback**: Users can see exactly which notes are playing
- **Enhanced Learning**: Visual association between MIDI data and piano keys
- **Synchronized Experience**: Highlighting matches audio playback and visual scrolling
- **Responsive Interface**: Updates smoothly during both automated and manual position changes
- **Channel Awareness**: Respects channel filtering (deleted channels don't highlight)

## Testing
- ✅ All keyboard highlighting features properly implemented
- ✅ No syntax errors or runtime issues
- ✅ Proper integration with existing playback system
- ✅ Verification scripts confirm functionality

This implementation provides a complete Synthesia-style keyboard visualization experience with real-time note highlighting that enhances the MIDI learning and visualization capabilities of the application.
