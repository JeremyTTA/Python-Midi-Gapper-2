# PLAYBACK POSITION FIX - FINAL SOLUTION

## Problem Analysis

After examining the code, I identified several critical issues:

1. **Tempo Handling**: The temp file creation doesn't properly preserve tempo changes that occur before the target position
2. **Message Timing**: The first message adjustment calculation has an error in the logic
3. **Position Synchronization**: The visual position and audio position get out of sync

## Root Causes

### 1. Missing Tempo Context
When creating the temp MIDI file, the code starts with a default tempo (500000 Âµs/beat) but doesn't account for tempo changes that occurred before the target position. This means if the original file had tempo changes early on, the new file plays at the wrong tempo.

### 2. Incorrect First Message Timing
The calculation for adjusting the first message's timing has a logical error:
```python
time_offset = current_time - start_time_seconds
tick_offset = mido.second2tick(time_offset, mid.ticks_per_beat, current_tempo)
new_time = max(0, msg.time - tick_offset)
```

This subtracts the offset from the message's delta time, but this is incorrect because:
- `msg.time` is the delta time from the previous message
- `time_offset` is how far past the target we are
- We should set the first message's time to start immediately, not subtract an offset

### 3. Tempo State Not Preserved
The new MIDI file doesn't include the current tempo state at the start position, so it defaults to the initial tempo.

## Solutions

### 1. Preserve Tempo Context
Before creating the temp file, scan through to the target position and capture:
- All tempo changes that occurred before the target
- The current tempo at the target position
- Any other necessary control changes

### 2. Fix First Message Timing
The first message in the new file should have time=0 to start immediately, and all subsequent messages should maintain their original delta times.

### 3. Add Initial Tempo Setting
The new MIDI file should start with a tempo change message if the current tempo differs from the default.

## Implementation

The fix involves rewriting the `create_temp_midi_from_position` method with proper tempo handling and timing logic.
