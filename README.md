Midi Gapper
--------------

This is a Python program to load a Midi file and search for all gaps smaller than a user defined size. It will remove enough of the duration of the previous note to achieve this. This is for Player Piano's that need a non-zero gap in order to restrike the key.

All the midi channels are displayed in a list. if you click S next to channel name it will select it and unselect all the other tracks. If you right click the channel you can delete a track

My plan is for this program to evolve into a general purpose program for playing midi files in a synthesia-like way. It will also allow me to schedule notes based on calibration routines built-in.
