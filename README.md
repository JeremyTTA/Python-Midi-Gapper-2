## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pygame mido tkinter xml
```

### Installation
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed
3. Run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Basic Usage
1. **Load a MIDI file**: Click "Open MIDI File" or use the last opened file
2. **View the visualization**: See your MIDI data as a piano roll with colored channels
3. **Play the music**: Use the media controls (‚èÆ ‚ñ∂/‚è∏ ‚èπ) to control playback
4. **Navigate**: Scroll through the timeline or use arrow keys for precise seeking
5. **Edit**: Add gaps between notes or modify channels as needed
6. **Save**: Export your modified MIDI file

## üéπ Controls

### Media Player Controls
- **‚èÆ Rewind**: Return to start (position 0:00.000)
- **‚ñ∂/‚è∏ Play/Pause**: Toggle playback (also **Space Bar**)
- **‚èπ Stop**: Stop playback and reset position

### Navigation
- **Arrow Keys**: 
  - `Left/Right`: Seek ¬±1 second
  - `Shift+Left/Right`: Seek ¬±5 seconds  
  - `Up/Down`: Scroll visualization vertically
- **Mouse Wheel**: Scroll through timeline
- **Scrollbar**: Manual position control with visual sync

### Editing
- **Gap Controls**: Set gap duration (ms) and apply to loaded MIDI
- **Channel Legend**: Toggle channel visibility or select single channels
- **Text View**: Direct XML editing of MIDI structure

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **MidiGapperGUI**: Main application class with Tkinter UI
- **MIDI Processing**: Uses `mido` library for file I/O and manipulation
- **Audio Engine**: pygame mixer for real-time MIDI playback
- **Visualization**: Canvas-based piano roll with spatial optimization
- **Timing System**: Unified timing logic for perfect audio/visual sync

### Key Technical Features
- **Temporal MIDI File Creation**: Generates temporary files for accurate seeking
- **Spatial Note Indexing**: Optimized rendering for large MIDI files (>3000 notes)
- **Real-time Audio Position Calculation**: Handles pygame seeking limitations
- **Channel-aware Highlighting**: Respects deleted channels in visualization
- **Configuration Persistence**: Auto-saves window state and last opened file

### File Format Support
- **Input**: `.mid`, `.midi` files (MIDI Format 0, 1, 2)
- **Output**: Standard MIDI files with preserved timing and channel data
- **Internal**: XML representation for advanced editing capabilities

## üéØ Advanced Features

### Gap Creation Algorithm
Intelligently inserts time gaps between notes while preserving:
- Note timing relationships
- Channel assignments  
- Tempo changes
- Control change events
- Program change events

### Visualization Optimization
- **Performance Scaling**: Adapts highlighting frequency based on file size
- **Viewport Culling**: Only processes notes visible in current view
- **Color Management**: 16 distinct channel colors with automatic assignment
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized canvas object management

### Timing Synchronization
- **Unified Clock**: Single source of truth for all timing calculations
- **Audio-Visual Sync**: Compensates for pygame MIDI seeking limitations  
- **Position Accuracy**: Millisecond-precise position tracking
- **State Persistence**: Maintains timing through pause/resume cycles

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

The application automatically creates a `config.json` file to store:
- Last opened MIDI file path
- Window geometry and state (maximized/normal)
- Y-scale factor for visualization
- User preferences

## üìä Supported MIDI Data

### MIDI Events
- **Note On/Off**: Full velocity and channel support
- **Program Changes**: Instrument assignments per channel
- **Control Changes**: Pedal, volume, pan, etc.
- **Tempo Changes**: Variable tempo throughout the file
- **Time Signatures**: Multiple time signatures supported

### Channel Features
- **16-channel support** with distinct color coding
- **General MIDI instrument names** for program changes
- **Channel muting/soloing** through visibility controls
- **Per-channel statistics** in the interface
