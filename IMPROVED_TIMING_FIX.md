# Keyboard Highlighting Timing Fix

## Problem Solved
Fixed the issue where keyboard highlighting was occurring well before the actual MIDI audio playback, especially when seeking to positions in the middle of a song.

## Root Cause
The problem was due to pygame's MIDI seeking limitation:
- **Visual Position**: When user seeks to 10 seconds and hits play, the visual timer continues from 10 seconds
- **Audio Position**: Due to pygame limitation, audio always starts from 0 seconds regardless of seek position
- **Previous Behavior**: Keyboard highlighting was using incorrect timing calculations, causing notes to highlight too early

## Solution Implemented

### Enhanced Audio Position Calculation
```python
def get_actual_audio_position(self):
    # Calculate elapsed time since audio started
    elapsed_time = time.time() - self.playback_start_time
    
    if self.visual_position_offset > 0.1:  # When seeking
        audio_position = elapsed_time  # Audio always starts from 0
        
        # If audio hasn't caught up to seek position, disable highlighting
        if audio_position < self.visual_position_offset:
            return -1  # Signal to disable highlighting
        else:
            # Audio has caught up, resume normal highlighting
            return self.visual_position_offset + elapsed_time
    else:
        # Started from beginning, positions are in sync
        return elapsed_time
```

### Smart Highlighting Logic
```python
def update_keyboard_highlighting(self):
    audio_position = self.get_actual_audio_position()
    
    # If audio_position is -1, disable highlighting until audio catches up
    if audio_position < 0:
        return  # Keys remain in default state (no highlighting)
    
    # Normal highlighting logic for notes at audio_position
    # ...
```

## Behavior Changes

### Before Fix:
- **Seek to 10s → Play**: Notes at 10s+ immediately highlighted while audio plays from 0s
- **Result**: Highlighting was ~10 seconds ahead of actual audio

### After Fix:
- **Seek to 10s → Play**: No highlighting until audio catches up to 10s position
- **Result**: Highlighting perfectly matches actual audio timing

## Test Cases Covered

1. **Start from Beginning**: Normal highlighting (audio and visual in sync)
2. **Seek to Middle**: Highlighting disabled until audio catches up
3. **Audio Caught Up**: Normal highlighting resumes once audio reaches seek position
4. **Manual Seeking**: Immediate visual feedback when not playing

## Benefits
- ✅ **Perfect Audio Sync**: Highlighting now matches exactly what's being heard
- ✅ **No Early Highlighting**: Eliminates confusing early note highlights
- ✅ **Intuitive Behavior**: Users see highlights only when notes are actually playing
- ✅ **Backward Compatible**: Doesn't affect normal playback from beginning
- ✅ **Visual Feedback**: Manual seeking still provides immediate visual response

This fix resolves the timing mismatch while working within pygame's MIDI limitations, providing an accurate and intuitive keyboard highlighting experience.
