# Play-from-Scroll and Tempo Fix - FINAL

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Play from Position Not Working
**Problem**: When scrolling to a position and pressing play, the MIDI would start from the beginning instead of the scrolled position.

**Root Cause**: The `create_temp_midi_from_position` method had several issues:
- Was using a hardcoded default tempo (500000 µs = 120 BPM) 
- Didn't properly use the actual tempo from the loaded MIDI file
- Had insufficient debug output to identify problems

**Fix Applied**:
- Modified `create_temp_midi_from_position` to use the actual tempo from `self.tempo_us`
- Added extensive debug output to track tempo changes and timing calculations
- Improved tempo handling throughout the seeking process
- Added better error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 2. Tempo Issues
**Problem**: The playback tempo seemed incorrect when seeking to positions.

**Root Cause**: The tempo calculation was using a fixed default instead of the actual tempo from the MIDI file.

**Fix Applied**:
- Now uses `getattr(self, 'tempo_us', 500000)` to get the actual tempo
- Properly tracks tempo changes throughout each track
- Logs tempo changes for debugging: `"Tempo change at Xs to Y µs/beat (Z BPM)"`

## Key Changes Made

### In `create_temp_midi_from_position()`:
```python
# OLD: Fixed default tempo
current_tempo = 500000  # Default MIDI tempo (120 BPM)

# NEW: Use actual tempo from MIDI file
initial_tempo = getattr(self, 'tempo_us', 500000)
print(f"Using initial tempo: {initial_tempo} µs/beat ({60e6/initial_tempo:.1f} BPM)")
```

### Enhanced Debug Output:
- Shows actual tempo being used
- Tracks tempo changes during playback
- Reports number of messages added to each track
- Confirms temporary file creation success

### In `start_midi_playback()` and `update_playback_position_from_scroll()`:
- Added detailed debug messages to track the seeking process
- Shows scroll position calculations
- Confirms when temporary files are created vs. fallback mode

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### When Working Correctly:
1. **Load MIDI file** - Console shows: `"Using initial tempo: X µs/beat (Y BPM)"`
2. **Scroll to position** - Console shows: `"Scroll position updated: As → Bs"`
3. **Press play** - Console shows:
   ```
   Creating MIDI file starting at X.XXs
   Track 0: Added N messages to new MIDI file
   Successfully created temporary MIDI file: /path/to/temp/file
   MIDI playback started successfully from X.XXs
   ```

### If Falling Back (mido issues):
- Console shows: `"Note: Seeking to X.XXs (visual sync only - audio will start from beginning)"`

## Debug Output Guide

### Good Output (Working):
```
Scroll position updated: 0.00s → 45.32s (scroll_bottom: 0.123)
Starting MIDI playback from position 45.32s
Creating temporary MIDI file for seeking to 45.32s
Using initial tempo: 500000 µs/beat (120.0 BPM)
Track 0: Added 1234 messages to new MIDI file
Track 1: Added 567 messages to new MIDI file
Successfully created temporary MIDI file: /tmp/midi_seek_ABC123.mid
MIDI playback started successfully from 45.32s (visual_offset: 45.32s)
```

### Problem Output (Not Working):
```
Scroll position updated: 0.00s → 45.32s (scroll_bottom: 0.123)
Starting MIDI playback from position 45.32s
Creating temporary MIDI file for seeking to 45.32s
Error creating MIDI file with mido: [error message] - falling back to visual sync
Note: Seeking to 45.32s (visual sync only - audio will start from beginning)
Warning: Could not create temp file, starting from beginning
```

## Testing Instructions

### To Test the Fix:
1. **Run the application**: `python main.py`
2. **Load a MIDI file** (watch console for tempo messages)
3. **Scroll to middle of song** (not at beginning)
4. **Press play button** ▶
5. **Check console output** for debug messages
6. **Listen**: Audio should start from scrolled position, not beginning

### Verifying Tempo is Correct:
- Compare playback speed with original MIDI file in other players
- Check console for tempo messages: `"Using initial tempo: X µs/beat (Y BPM)"`
- Tempo should match the actual MIDI file tempo, not always 120 BPM

## Files Modified
- `main.py`: Enhanced `create_temp_midi_from_position()`, `start_midi_playback()`, `update_playback_position_from_scroll()`
- `test_playback_fix.py`: Test script to verify the fix

## Dependencies
- `mido`: For MIDI file manipulation ✓ (already installed)
- `pygame`: For MIDI playback ✓ (already installed)

## Backward Compatibility
- ✅ Still works if mido has issues (falls back to visual sync only)
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Temporary files are automatically cleaned up

The fix maintains full backward compatibility while significantly improving the play-from-scroll functionality and tempo accuracy.
