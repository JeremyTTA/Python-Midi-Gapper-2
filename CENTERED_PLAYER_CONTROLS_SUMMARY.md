# MIDI Gapper Centered Player Controls

## ✅ Player Controls Successfully Centered!

The player controls have been restructured to be centered horizontally on the screen.

## New Layout Structure:

### Top Section (Horizontal Layout):
- **Left**: File Controls (Open MIDI, Save MIDI)
- **Left-Center**: Gap Controls (Gap input, Create Gaps button)  
- **Center**: MIDI Info (File details, tracks, format, tempo, etc.)
- **Right**: Channels (Channel legend with scrollable list)

### Centered Section (New):
- **🎮 Player Controls** (Horizontally Centered)
  - Rewind button (⏮)
  - Play/Pause button (▶/⏸) 
  - Stop button (⏹)
  - LED Clock display below buttons

### Bottom Section:
- Notebook tabs (Visualization, etc.)

## Key Changes Made:

### 1. **Separated Layout Sections**:
- `top_section`: File controls, gap controls, MIDI info, and channels
- `player_section`: Dedicated section for centered player controls
- `center_container`: Container that centers the player controls frame

### 2. **Centering Implementation**:
```python
# Create centered container for player controls
center_container = ttk.Frame(player_section)
center_container.pack(expand=True)  # This centers the container

# Player controls frame packs inside the centered container
play_controls_frame = ttk.LabelFrame(center_container, text='🎮 Player Controls')
play_controls_frame.pack()
```

### 3. **Preserved Features**:
- ✅ Modern button styling with hover effects
- ✅ Enhanced LED clock with glow effects
- ✅ All existing functionality (play-from-scroll, etc.)
- ✅ Responsive layout
- ✅ Professional color scheme

### 4. **Visual Improvements**:
- **Better Visual Balance**: Player controls now prominently centered
- **Clear Separation**: Controls are visually separated from other UI elements
- **Professional Layout**: More organized and intuitive interface
- **Maintained Functionality**: All buttons and features work as before

## Benefits:

1. **🎯 Enhanced Focus**: Player controls are now the visual centerpiece
2. **📱 Better UX**: More intuitive and professional layout
3. **⚖️ Visual Balance**: Better distribution of UI elements
4. **🔧 Maintained Functionality**: All existing features preserved
5. **🎨 Modern Design**: Clean, centered layout with enhanced styling

The player controls are now prominently displayed in the center of the interface, making them the primary focus while keeping all other controls accessible on the sides. This creates a more professional and user-friendly interface.
